== Services and Operations

Each message requires a message in return (at least an acknowledgement).

Each system must be able to cope with possible connection error scenarios as well as with different strategies to solve inconsistencies.

All described services are offered by Hubject. Some of the described services `MUST` also be offered by the connected provider systems because Hubject forwards incoming requests to partners which presumes that the corresponding service is offered by that partner (e.g. <<eRoamingAuthorization,eRoamingAuthorization>>)

Other services will only be consumed by partner systems, meaning that these services do not have to be offered by the partner system (e.g. the eRoamingAuthenticationData service will be offered by Hubject only).

The names of all following services contain a version and are based on the pattern “<service>_V<version>”, e.g. “eRoamingAuthorization_V2.1”. The reason for this being that Hubject potentially has to offer different versions of a service at the same time. This requires different technical service endpoints (service URLs) and the version in the service name is used to enable the service endpoint differentiation.

[.underline]#*Functional Description:*#

Scenario:

A customer of an EMP wants to charge a vehicle at a charging point of a CPO. The customer authenticates at the charging point. The CPO’s operator system does not recognize the customer’s authentication data. In order to authorize the charging process, the CPO’s system can send an eRoamingAuthorizeStart request to Hubject. The request `MUST` contain the OperatorID and the identification data (e.g. UID or EvcoID) and `MAY` contain the EvseID.

Hubject generates a SessionID for the charging process and persists important session data (SessionID, EvseID, identification data).

Regarding the further service processing, there are three different options:

[upperalpha]
..	Hubject first tries to authorize the customer offline by checking authentication master data. Authentication data can be uploaded by EMPs using the eRoamingAuthenticationData service.

image::images/authorizestart_offline.png[]

[upperalpha, start=2]
.. In case offline authorization is not possible, Hubject tries to derive the EMP from the provided identification data. QR Code and Plug&Charge identification data contain the EvcoID. Hubject can derive the EMP’s ProviderID from the EvcoID. Hubject will directly forward eRoamingAuthorizeStart requests to the EMP. The EMP provider system checks the requested authentication data and responds accordingly, either by authorizing or not authorizing the request. The response `MUST` contain the ProviderID and the AuthorizationStatus and `MAY` contain a list of identification data that is authorized to stop the charging process. In case that the EMP provider system cannot be addressed (e.g. due to technical problems), the corresponding provider will be dealt with as if responding “NotAuthorized”.

image::images/authorize_evco.png[]

[upperalpha, start=3]

.. In case that Hubject cannot derive the EMP from the identification data (e.g. with RFID identification), Hubject identifies all EMPs that are under contract with the CPO (EMPs must be the service subscriber) and forwards the eRoamingAuthorizeStart request to all these EMPs (broadcast). Hubject consolidates all EMP responses and creates an overall response, authorizing the request in case that one EMP authorized the request.

image::images/authorizestart_online.png[]

In case that the request for authorization was not successful, Hubject deletes the corresponding SessionID for the charging process.

The response from Hubject to the CPO contains authorization details and in case of successful authorization the created SessionID and the ProviderID of the authorizing provider.

[.underline]#*Pin Security:*#

The eRoamingAuthorizeStart request contains one of the defined identification types (see <<03_CPO_Data_Types.adoc#IdentificationType,IdentificationType>>). The identification
type “QRCodeIdentificationType” (see <<03_CPO_Data_Types.adoc#QRCodeIdentificationType,QRCodeIdentificationType>>) contains - besides the “EvcoID” field - a “PIN” field or a “HashedPIN”
field (only one of the two options must be provided).

For security reasons and as a general rule, Hubject does not store PINs in clear text, but always as encrypted hash
values. In order to prevent hashed PIN values that may have been picked illegally from being used to request the
authorization for charging processes, the PIN value `MUST` always be provided in clear text within the
eRoamingAuthorizeStart request. This means that this operation `MUST` always provide the “PIN” field (clear text).
Hubject will always generate a hash value of the provided PIN before checking the offline authentication data. So,
in case that a PIN is provided by mistake as hashed value, Hubject automatically generates a hash of a hash,
which eventually leads to a denial of authorization

In order to create hash values, Hubject applies the hash algorithm that the EMP has assigned to the QR Code
identification record

eRoamingAuthorizeStop basically works in a similar way to the operation eRoamingAuthorizeStart. The request is
sent in order to authorize the stopping of a charging process. The request `MUST` contain the SessionID that was
created by Hubject after the initial eRoamingAuthorizeStart request. In most cases, Hubject can derive the EMP
that authorized the charging process from the SessionID and can directly and offline authorize the request or
forward the request for stopping to the EMP. In case the charging session was originally authorized offline by the
HBS, the session `MUST` only be stopped with the same medium, which was used for starting the session

*Functional description:*

*Scenario:*

A customer of an EMP wants to charge a vehicle at a charging station of a CPO. The customer informs his EMP of his intention,
e.g. via mobile phone or smart phone application. The EMP’s provider system can then initiate a charging
process at the CPO’s charging station by sending an eRoamingAuthorizeRemoteStart request to Hubject. The request MUST contain the ProviderID and the EvseID.

Hubject will derive the CPO’s OperatorID from the EvseID.

Hubject will check whether there is a valid contract between the two partners for the service (EMP must be the subscriber).
If so, Hubject continues with checking the charging point compatibility.
In case that the CPO has uploaded at least one charging point data record, Hubject will check whether the requested EvseID is
among the uploaded data. If not, Hubject will respond with the status code 603 “Unknown EvseID”.
If yes, Hubject will check whether the charging spot’s property “IsHubjectCompatible” is set “true”.
If the property is false, Hubject will respond with the status code 604 “EvseID is not Hubject compatible”.

In case that the requested EvseID is compatible or the CPO has not uploaded any EVSE records at all,
Hubject generates a SessionID for the following process and forwards the request (including the SessionID) to the CPO.
The CPO `MUST` return an eRoamingAcknowledgement message that `MUST` contain the result indicating whether the charging process will be started and that `MAY`
contain a status code for further information.

In case that the CPO’s system cannot be addressed (e.g. due to technical problems), Hubject will return to the requestor a “false” result and a message
indicating the connection error.

[.underline]#*Functional Description:*#

Scenario:

A customer of an EMP has charged a vehicle at a charging station of a CPO. The charging process was started with an eRoamingAuthorizeStart or an eRoamingAuthorizeRemoteStart operation. The process may have been stopped with an eRoamingAuthorizeStop or an eRoamingAuthorizeRemoteStop operation. A preceding stop request is not a necessary precondition for the processing of an eRoamingChargeDetailRecord request. The CPO’s provider system MUST send an eRoamingChargeDetailRecord (CDR) after the end of the charging process in order to inform the EMP of the charging session data (e.g. meter values and consumed energy) and further charging process details.

NOTE: The CPO MUST provide the same SessionID that was assigned to the corresponding charging process. Based on this information Hubject will be able to assign the session data to the correct process.

Hubject will identify the receiving EMP and will forward the CDR to the corresponding EMP. The EMP `MUST` return an eRoamingAcknowledgement message that `MUST` contain the result indicating whether the session data was received successfully and that `MAY` contain a status code for further information.

Hubject will accept only one CDR per SessionID.

In addition to forwarding the CDR to the EMP, Hubject also stores the CDR. In case that the recipient provider’s system cannot be addressed (e.g. due to technical problems), Hubject will nevertheless return to the requestor a positive result provided that storing the CDR was successful.

[[eRoamingEvseData]]
== eRoamingEvseData

Hubject offers the possibility to upload and download charging spot (EVSE) data and, thus, to exchange data between different partners.


See <<04_Appendix.adoc#Appendix, Appendix>> for a detailed business process diagram regarding the EVSE data service.


The eRoamingEvseData service offers two operations:

. eRoamingPushEvseData in order to give CPOs the possibility to upload (push) EVSE master data
. eRoamingPullEvseData in order to give EMPs the possibility to download (pull) EVSE data from partner operators via Hubject.

Hub CPOs may also push EVSE data of sub operators. Hubject does not distinguish between EVSE records of hub operators and related sub operators.

- <<eRoamingAcknowledgementmessage,Response message: eRoamingAcknowledgement>>

image::images/pushevsedata.png[]

When a CPO sends an eRoamingPushEvseData request, Hubject checks whether there is a valid contract between Hubject and the CPO for the service type (Hubject must be the subscriber). If so, the operation allows uploading EVSE data to Hubject. Furthermore, it is possible to update or delete EVSE data that has been pushed with an earlier operation request. How Hubject handles the transferred data `MUST` be defined in the request field "ActionType", which offers four options.

The EvseData that will be inserted or updated `MUST` be provided in the <<03_CPO_Data_Types.adoc#OperatorIDType,OperatorEvseData>> field, which consists of <<03_CPO_Data_Types.adoc#EvseDataRecordType,EvseDataRecord>> structures. Hubject keeps a history of all updated and changed data records. Every successful push operation – irrespective of the performed action – leads to a new version of currently valid data records. Furthermore, every operation is logged with the current timestamp. Thus, Hubject can reconstruct the status of EvseData for every point in time in the past.

*EVSE consistency:*

EvseIDs contain the ID of the corresponding CPO (With every data upload operation Hubject checks whether the given CPO’s OperatorID or Sub-OperatorIDs if necessary) matches every given EvseID. If not, Hubject refuses the data upload and responds with the status code 018.

|Data field| Impact of neglecting the recommendation| Recommendation
|EvseID|The longer an EVSE ID is, the higher the possibility of errors.|Please create an EVSE ID without using up the technically possible length.
|Charging Station ID|No negative impact|If a CPO wants to add aditional information to each charge point which cannot be displayed in the EVSE ID (e.g. internal numeration of chargepoints) a CPO has the chance to fill in the charingStationID field
|ChargingStationName|End customers might lack a distinct name to remember the station or its operator with ease, if it is just identified via its EvseID.|We highly recommend to enter a valid name, e.g. “Charge point (your company brand name=“ using local language. This can be an additional information for end customers to easily identify charging stations
|Address|location based information, inaccurate address data will directly limit the stations visibility and future usage by end customers.|The address fields for charge points are highly recommended to be filled in accordingly to our best practice guide because they can be added value for end customer in finding their position.
|Country|Neglecting the ISO standard will lead to inconsistent information on the countries, the station are located in. The country is regarded as mandatory data.|Alpha 3 ISO (ISO 3166-1) code is required, (e.g. 'DEU', 'FRA', 'USA').
|City|As a mandatory field, missing city names will cause incomplete address data which will not be accepted.|Please enter the city in which the charging station is located.

[[eRoamingEvseStatus]]
== eRoamingEvseStatus

Hubject offers the possibility to upload and download dynamic charging spot (EVSE) status information and thus to exchange the data between different partners.

The eRoamingEvseStatus service offers two operations:

. eRoamingPushEvseStatus in order to give CPOs the possibility to upload (push) EvseStatus data
. eRoamingPullEvseStatus in order to give EMPs the possibility to download (pull) EVSE status data from partner operators via Hubject

Hub CPOs may also push EVSE status records of sub operators. Hubject does not distinguish between EvseStatus records of hub operators and related sub operators.

When a CPO sends an eRoamingPushEvseStatus request, Hubject checks whether there is a valid contract between Hubject and the CPO for the service type (Hubject must be the subscriber). If so, the operation allows uploading EVSE status data to Hubject. Furthermore, it is possible to update EVSE status data that has been pushed with an earlier operation request.

The way how Hubject handles the transferred data `MUST` be defined in the request field "ActionType2, which offers four options. This option works in the same way as the eRoamingAuthenticationData service. The EVSE status data that will be inserted or updated `MUST` be provided with the field <<03_CPO_Data_Types.adoc#OperatorEvseStatusType,“OperatorEvseStatus”>>, which consists of <<03_CPO_Data_Types.adoc#EvseStatusRecordType,“EvseStatusRecord”>> structures. Hubject keeps a history of all updated and changed data records. Every successful push operation – irrespective of the performed action – leads to a new version of currently valid data records. Furthermore, every operation is logged with the current timestamp. Thus, Hubject can reconstruct the status of EVSE status data for every point in time in the past.

NOTE: The eRoamingPushEvseStatus operation MUST always be used sequentiallyas described in Data Push Operations

[[eRoamingDynamicPricing]]
== eRoamingDynamicPricing

Since OICP 2.2, HBS  offers the possibility to flexibly or dynamically price Authorization services. The service mainly enables pushing (upload) and pulling (download) of pricing data to and from the HBS through webservice requests and/or downloads/uploads in the Hubject portal.

Flexible pricing enables CPOs to offer differentiated pricing (in multiple currencies) of charging processes at their charging stations. The differentiation of prices can be done along relevant dimensions such as charging facility characteristics (e.g. maximum charging power), EVSE location and time. OICP 2.2 and OICP 2.3 offers the possibility to exchange this flexible price differentiation over webservice communication between CPOs and EMPs.

In addition to the above flexible pricing capability, OICP 2.2 and OICP 2.3 enables more frequent and near real-time update and exchange of pricing information between CPOs and EMPs. This is achieved whereby a CPO continuously pushes valid prices to the HBS for specific EMPs to pull these prices.

With OICP 2.2 and OICP 2.3 , the HBS offers an extensive breadth of technical capabilities for flexible and dynamic pricing of charging services for CPOs. Please refer to the supplementary document https://support.hubject.com/hc/en-us/categories/360000238177-Flexible-Dynamic-Pricing[“Dynamic Pricing - Functional Guide for Service Implementation”] for more details and a holistic view (technical and business perspectives) of how to best capitalize on the capabilities offered by the eRoamingDynamicPricing service.

The eRoamingDynamicPricing service offers four operations, namely the:

. eRoamingPushPricingProductData operation which gives CPOs the possibility to upload (push) pricing product information. Pricing products refer to the different tariffs offered by a CPO based on the differentiation dimensions mentioned above.
. eRoamingPushEVSEPricing operation which gives CPOs the possibility to assign their various pricing products to individual EVSEs and thereby upload (push) location/EVSE-specific pricing data.
. eRoamingPullPricingProductData operation which gives EMPs the possibility to download (pull) pricing product information uploaded by a CPO for the respective EMP.
. eRoamingPullEVSEPricing operation which gives EMPs the possibility to download (pull) location/EVSE-specific pricing data uploaded by CPOs for the respective EMP.

The ChargingNotification feature enables CPOs to notify EMPs about the end of charge

The ChargingNotification feature basically increases the transparency between CPO - EMP - End Consumer to the level of each charging session.

This feature enables CPO to send various notifications during a single Charging Session. These notifications give the details like

. When the charging session has started. The CPO can send ChargingNotification of type “Start” to Hubject containing information like ChargingStart, MeterStartValue, EVSEID etc.
. Consumed Energy values during the charging process or duration of successful charging process that has lapsed. The CPO can send ChargingNotification of type “Progress” to Hubject containing information like ChargingStart, EventOccurred, ChargingDuration, ConsumedEnergyProgress, EVSEID etc. The frequency between two progress notifications for one charging session should be at least 5 minutes.
. When the charging session has ended (because no energy is transmitted anymore). The CPO can send a ChargingNotification of type “End” to Hubject containing information such as ChargingEnd, ConsumedEnergy, EVSEID etc.
. Error occurred before charging starts or during charging process or abrupt changing end. The CPO can send a ChargingNotification of type “Error” to Hubject containing information such as ErrorClass, ErrorAdditionalInfo, EVSEID etc.

Hubject will forward Start, Progress, End and Error notification requests to the EMP. The EMP responds with an eRoamingAcknowledgement. This acknowledgement is then being forwarded to the CPO.

This feature should cover all the notifications that could happen between Session Start and Session End in future. Each bit of information increases transparency to the customer of EMP.

[[eRoamingChargingNotificationsstart]]
=== eRoamingChargingNotifications Start

A customer of EMP Authorizes the charging session at particular charging station (via any means for eg REFID card, Mobile etc). The charging session is authorized by Hubject / CPO system. The authorization of charging process and plugging the cable in EV does not guarantee that energy flow into the Vehicle is initiated. It is really important for for EMP and its end consumer to know if the charging has started.

The CPO’s backend system MAY send a ChargingNotification of type “Start” after the CPO considers the charging of an EV is started (since energy flow have started) in order to inform the EMP that the actual charging (the energy flow) of the vehicle has started.

[[eRoamingChargingNotificationsprogress]]
=== eRoamingChargingNotifications Progress

A customer of EMP has started the charging session. Just like as that of regular gasoline stations customer would like to know either how much charging Duration have passed or how much energy is consumed by the EV so far. This information will help Customer to decide if he/she wants to stop the charging session as per their affordability or journey planning.

The CPO’s backend system MAY send a ChargingNotification of type “Progess” after the CPO gets the charging energy or time information from EVSEID. This is required in order to inform the EMP that the progress energy or chargingduration for a perticular charging session.

It is really important for Customer as well as EMP to know what exactly is happening at the charging process. This notification eventually helps EMPs well informed about the problem occurred with the charging process. This information can be easily passed onto Customer so that he/she can take appropriate action.

The CPO’s backend system MAY send a ChargingNotification of type “Error” after the CPO gets an information about the error at the charging station. The CPO can transmit one of the ErrorClass defined by Hubject along with the additional information which elaborated the Error. The customer has to take one of the three action EV needs to be charged at some different station, Cables is properly attached or the error is for information only no action required by customer.
