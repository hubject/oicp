[[Introduction]]
== Introduction

This document aims to provide an overview of all changes implemented with the release of version 2.3 of the OICP protocol.
In the Chapters that follow, the respective changes in comparison to OICP 2.2 are highlighted to provide a quick overview of the affected services and data fields.
For detailed descriptions, please refer to the full-blown OICP 2.3 specification. Please note that the leading document for a fully compliant implementation of OICP 2.3 is the full-blown OICP 2.3 document rather than this document.

From OICP 2.3 version only REST API’s are offered.

== OICP 2.3 Data Type Changes

The OICP 2.3 include new fields which also include new data types that are being share in a list below. For more detail of each data type, please refer to the Data Types section of the OICP 2.3 documentation in GitHub.

*New Data Type:*

* EnergySourceType
* EnvironmentalImpactType
* SignedMeteringValuesType
* CalibrationLawVerificationType
* AccessibilityLocationType
* EnergyType
* CalibrationLawDataAvailabilityType
* MeteringStatusType
* ErrorClassType


[[OICPVersionsCrossFunctional]]
== OICP Versions - Cross Functional

The OICP 2.3 contains new fields that does not exists in the OICP 2.1 and OICP 2.2 versions. Therefore, when an EMP using OICP 2.3 performs an eRoamingPullEvseData it may not receive some values that are mandatory to provide for the CPO using OICP 2.3.

As well in OICP 2.3 there are fields that are mandatory for the CPO to provide but are optional for the CPO using OICP 2.2 or OICP 2.1 version.  Therefore, when an EMP using OICP 2.3 performs an eRoamingPullEvseData it may not receive some values (delivered by HBS as “null” that are mandatory to provide for the CPO using OICP 2.3.

In the following table you will find a comparison of mandatory fields between OICP 2.1, OICP 2.2 and OICP 2.3.
